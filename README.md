# reloaded

A Leiningen 2 template to generate project skeletons using
[tools.namespace] and a `:dev` profile with a `user.clj` file.

This template is based on the blog article [My Clojure Workflow, Reloaded].

[tools.namespace]: https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace

## Releases and Dependency Information

This template requires [Leiningen] 2.

I publish releases to [Clojars].

Current release is 0.1.3

No installation is necessary; Leiningen should automatically discover
and download the template.

[Clojars]: http://clojars.org/


## Usage

Run `lein new reloaded com.example/new-project` to generate a new
project skeleton in the `new-project` directory, with a structure like
this:

    .
    ├── README.md
    ├── project.clj
    ├── dev
    │   └── user.clj
    └── src
        └── com
            └── example
                └── new_project.clj

The `dev` directory contains files that you will use only during
interactive development, including `user.clj` which is automatically
loaded by Clojure at startup.

The `src` directory contains your application source files.

See the [article] for an explanation of how I use these files to
develop an application.

## Forking

I created this template for my own personal use, and I am publishing
it in the hopes that others will find it useful. I encourage you to
fork and modify this template to suit your own needs and personal
workflow, but I am unlikely to merge any changes into this repository.
